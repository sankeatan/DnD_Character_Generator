As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, 
and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your 
adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, 
shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any 
material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support 
you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. You might also have ties to a specific 
temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. 
This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with 
it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can 
call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not 
hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple."
